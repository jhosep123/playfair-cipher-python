# 🔐 playfair-cipher-python - Learn Classical Cipher Techniques Easily

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Playfair_Cipher-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/jhosep123/playfair-cipher-python/releases)

## 📖 What is playfair-cipher-python?

This is a simple Python program that lets you use the classical Playfair cipher. The Playfair cipher is an old method to encrypt text by substituting pairs of letters. This program helps you both encrypt (hide) and decrypt (reveal) messages with this technique. It is designed to teach how the Playfair cipher works and show basic cryptography ideas.

You don’t need to know how to program to use this software. It runs with easy commands and guides you step-by-step. It helps you explore secure communication methods from history in an educational way.

## 🧩 How to Use the Playfair Cipher Program

### Step 1: Choose an action

After starting the program, choose to either:

- Encrypt a message: Turn your plain text into secret code.
- Decrypt a message: Turn coded text back into readable form.

### Step 2: Enter your message

Type the message you want to encrypt or decrypt. Keep it simple—only letters and spaces work best.

### Step 3: Enter the key

The key is a word or phrase used to scramble the letters. For example, you can type your name or a favorite word. The program uses this key to build the cipher table.

### Step 4: See the result

The program shows your encrypted or decrypted text. You can use this result to send secret messages or learn how old ciphers work.
